# Bell Enclosure

This case was designed with [OpenSCAD](http://openscad.org), and STL files are also included here so you can print the enclosure parts directly.

The enclosure design is based on [@tenderlove's Analog Terminal Bell](https://github.com/tenderlove/analog-terminal-bell/tree/master/case).
